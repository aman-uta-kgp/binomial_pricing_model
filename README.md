# Binomial Pricing Model

## Project Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of the Binomial Pricing Model, specifically using the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) strategy. The model provides a numerical method for the valuation of options by simulating different possible paths the underlying asset's price can take over time.
The Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial model is a discrete-time model for pricing options, introduced by John C. Cox, Stephen A. Ross, and Mark Rubinstein in 1979. It constructs a binomial tree to model the possible future prices of the underlying asset.
